			<p>The number of evictions filings in the south Bronx is disproportionately high compared to its share of the population in NYC. The expiration of eviction memorandum in NY lifted tenant protections, but the communities of the south Bronx, and Bronx County, are the most vulnerable according to data by the Eviction Lab, a Princeton University organization that tracks eviction filings by zip codes. 
                
			</p>
			<p>
				A combination of factors is fueling these cases Stacey Williams, a senior staff attorney at Bronx Legal Aid, said. Amongst them are unstable employment, skyrocketing rent increases, and that this is an underserved community. In some other cases, people ignore their rights or lack attorney representation.  
			</p>

            <p>“I think is because it’s a borough with folks struggling to get by,” Williams said. She also said that “having a lawyer definitely has a huge impact.”  
                </p>

             <p>
                For this chart, the percent of eviction filings for the South Bronx was calculated by combining the total number of its zip codes using data from Eviction Lab. Its total and percent was calculated using the latest available data recorded until Nov. 5, 2022.
                 
             </p>
<p>
    The percent for each county was calculated with data by the New York State Unified Court System. This data was collected until Nov. 14, 2022. Population data was based on the 2020 Census.

    The city’s lockdown due to the COVID 19 pandemic left people without jobs and put them behind their rents and other bills. Despite people going back to work and things going back to normal, they are months behind payments making it almost impossible to catch up.

    “Where are we going to get the money from,” Galvez said. She lives in a 2-bedroom apartment with her 10-year-old daughter in Melrose, the third zip code with the highest number of eviction filings. “My daughter was basically born here.” 

</p>
<p>
    Data also reveals that 9 out of the top 10 zip codes with the highest numbers are from Bronx County.
